# Demo of PSyKI

This repository is meant to be a demo of the PSyKI Python API.
In our intentions, a user should be able to get started with PSyKI by cloning this repository and running the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

All notebooks are self-contained and should be runnable in a fresh environment.
